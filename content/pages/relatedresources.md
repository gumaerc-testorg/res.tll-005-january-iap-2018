## Professor Winston’s Courses on OCW

Professor Winston was widely known for teaching [*6.034 Artificial Intelligence*](/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010), a class that introduced students to the basic knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence.

Another course long taught by Professor Winston was [*6.803 The Human Intelligence Enterprise*](/courses/6-803-the-human-intelligence-enterprise-spring-2019)*,* which was designed to help students learn about progress toward the scientific goal of understanding human intelligence from a computational point of view.
